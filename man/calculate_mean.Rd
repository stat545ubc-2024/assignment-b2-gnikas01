\title{Calculate Mean with Optional Rounding}
\usage{
calculate_mean(x, round_to = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector. This parameter is named 'x' as it is a common convention in statistics to denote a variable or dataset.}

\item{round_to}{Number of decimal places to round the result to (default is NULL, meaning no rounding). The name 'round_to' clearly indicates its purpose of specifying how many decimal places the output should be rounded to.}
}
\value{
The mean of the input vector, optionally rounded to the specified number of decimal places. If no rounding is specified, it returns the mean as a numeric value.
}
\description{
This function calculates the mean of a numeric vector, excluding NA values,
and allows for optional rounding of the result.
}
\examples{
calculate_mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
calculate_mean(c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5))
calculate_mean(c(1.11, 2.22, 3.33, NA, 5.55), round_to = 1)
